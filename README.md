# QCX_enclosure_LA4ZCA
A compact enclosure with integrated paddles for the QCX amateur radio transceiver kit

This note describes a design for a 3D printed enclosure for the QCX transceiver kit from QRP labs. The goal for the design has been to make a small and self-contained unit, to make it easy to bring the transceiver along for portable operation. Therefore, many features are built in:
•	paddles which can be flipped to a parking position for storage
•	speaker, in addition to an earphone connector
•	LiPo 4s battery, giving a transmit power of 5W
•	GPS for WSPR operation, enabled or disabled by the power switch

Construction is described in some detail in the document "Compact 3D printed QCX enclosure - construction notes"
